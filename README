NAME
    Kwiki::Indexer - A Base Class for Kwiki Indexing Plugins

SYNOPSIS
    kwiki -add Kwiki::Indexer::Subclass

DESCRIPTION
    Kwiki::Indexer is a base class for implementing plugins that index Kwiki
    sites.

    This distribution ships with an example plugin Kwiki::Indexer::Regex.
    This plugin doesn't actually index the site, it simply defines a
    perform_search method that does a regex search across all active pages
    in the Kwiki (based the search implemented in Brian Ingerson's
    Kwiki::Search plugin).
